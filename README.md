## Description
My best friend "smol gurl" and I love Iceland and it truly is a dream destination of mine. I had this vision to make an interactive map with an info-box and and img-box but the latter has still not been implemented the way I intended. Nevertheless, this is v1.

## Key Learnings
* Learning about SVGs and a bit of XML
* Learning how to make simple SVG maps and use them as part of a website
* Learning a lot about Iceland (duh)
